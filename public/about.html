<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Anjola, but most people know me as AJ.<br/>
  I know and do a lot of things but I'll limit it to: Content writing, DeFi exploring and Airdrop farming.<br/>
  I have been in-and-out of the web3 space for 3 years but became fully active last year after bagging my Computer Science degree (Glory be to God).

  I always wanted to pick up a skill after school but the skill I had in mind was UI/UX and Motion design.<br/>
  I spoke to a few of my friends (Adams, Timi, Goldman) and came to the conclusion of learning how to code first.<br/>
  Then I would go on to use that knowledge to master vibe-coding (because AI is the future) before picking any other skill.<br/>
  If you're seeing this is a standalone page or as a part of my portfolio website, it is proof that I have been consistent. The journey is far from being complete but at least, I have begun and it's only up from here.<br/>
